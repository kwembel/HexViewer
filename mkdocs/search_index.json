Valid numbers are must be divisible by bytes and currently go up to 128 bits.       // Group bytes together by bits \n     // Valid Settings (8|16|32|64|128) \n     group_bytes_by_bits   :   16 ,   valid_bytes_per_line  Sets the number of valid bytes that will be allowed for the  valid_bytes_per_line .  Keep in mind though that just be because a value is deemed valid here, there are still some restriction that are covered in  bytes_per_line .       // These are the valid bytes per line options \n     valid_bytes_per_line   :   [ 8 ,   10 ,   16 ,   24 ,   32 ,   48 ,   64 ,   128 ,   256 ,   512 ],   bytes_per_line  Number of bytes that will be shown on a line.  Can be any value found in  valid_bytes_per_line .  Even if the value is valid, there are some things to be aware of. HexViewer will default to a more reasonable value if the following does not hold true  bytes_per_line / (group_bytes_by_bits / 8) == 0 ; if this does not hold true, there will be an adjustment made to the final number of bytes per line.       // Number of 8 bit bytes per line. \n     // See  valid_bytes_per_line  for valid options \n     bytes_per_line   :   24 ,   custom_font  Sets the font used in a HexViewer view.  It is strongly recommended to set this to a monospaced font if your default font is not monospaced.       // Use None to use the current Sublime Text font. \n     custom_font   :   none ,   custom_font_size  Sets the font size to be used in a HexViewer view.       // Use zero to use the current Sublime Text font size. \n     custom_font_size   :   0 ,   inspector  Sets whether the Hex Inspector panel is enabled.  To have the Hex Inspector panel auto-open when a HexViewer view loads, see  inspector_auto_show .       // Show inspector panel \n     inspector   :   true ,   inspector_endian  Sets the endianness of the displayed values in the inspector.  The string value of  big  and  little  can be used.       // endian? (big|little) \n     inspector_endian   :   big ,   inspector_auto_show  Sets whether the Hex Inspector panel will auto-show on HexViewer view load.  If this is disabled, the Hex Inspector panel can still be shown manually when desired.       // Show inspector panel on hex view load and hide on hex view hide \n     inspector_auto_show   :   true ,   inspector_integer_format  Controls the text format for integer output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.      // Inspector format strings: ints and unsigned ints \n     inspector_integer_format :   %-12s:  %-22d ,   inspector_float_format  Controls the text format for float output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.       // Inspector format strings: floating point decimals \n     insepctor_float_format :   %-12s:  %-22e ,   inspector_double_format  Controls the text format for double output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.       // Inspector format strings: double floating point decimal strings \n     inspector_double_format :   %-12s:  %-22e ,   inspector_missing/bad_format  Controls the text format for missing/bad output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.       // Inspector format strings:  NAN  and not enough bytes to show numbers  -- \n     inspector_missing/bad_format :   %-12s:  %-22s ,   inspector_binary_format  Controls the text format for binary output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.       // Binary number formatting \n     inspector_binary_format :   %-12s:  %-22s   enable_fake_hex_file  When loading a file that is a HexViewer visual representation of a binary file, and the syntax is set to HexViewer s custom syntax, HexViewer will enable basic byte highlight features, Hex Inspector panel etc.       // Treat files in hex syntax with proper format \n     // (usually .hex files; saved versions of hex output) \n     // as real hex views.  The following functionality will be omitted: \n     // hex toggle, editing, writing to file, \n     // and dynamic changing of bits and bytes functionality. \n     // Address searching, Hex inspector, etc. should work fine. \n     enable_fake_hex_file :   true ,   highlight_max_bytes  Sets the max number of allowed bytes that HexViewer will highlight when selected.  This is a setting that limits the highlight for the sake of performance.  Keep this set to a reasonable value.       // Approximate max byte selection. \n     // The highlighter will highlight individual selections until \n     // the max number of bytes is found.  The selection containing \n     // the maximum byte will still be finished even if it has more \n     // bytes than the max. \n     highlight_max_bytes   :   1000 ,   highlight_throttle  Sets whether  highlight_max_bytes  will be used.  This allows a user to not limit the number of highlighted bytes.  It is not recommended to use this for performances sake.       //Enable highlight throttling \n     highlight_throttle   :   false ,   highlight_scope  Define the highlight color when a byte or ASCII char is selected.  Colors must be a scope found in your theme file, if not, the color will be the default font color.       // Scope? (Defined in theme files.) \n     // Examples: (keyword|string|number) \n     highlight_scope   :   string ,   highlight_scope  Define the highlight color for bytes that have been edited.  Colors must be a scope found in your theme file, if not, the color will be the default font color.       highlight_edit_scope :   keyword ,   highlight_icon  Sets a gutter icon for highlighted bytes.  Default is set to the string  none  to hide the icon.  This can be changed to either  dot ,  circle ,  bookmark ,  cross , or  none .       // Icon? (dot|circle|bookmark|cross|none) \n     highlight_icon   :   none ,   highlight_edit_icon  Sets a gutter icon for edited bytes.  Default is set to the string  none  to hide the icon.  This can be changed to either  dot ,  circle ,  bookmark ,  cross ,  none .       highlight_edit_icon   :   none ,   highlight_style  Sets the highlight style for highlighted bytes.  Can be  solid ,  outline ,  underline , or  none .       // Style? (solid|outline|underline|none) \n     highlight_style   :   solid ,   highlight_edit_style  Sets the highlight style for edited bytes.  Can be  solid ,  outline ,  underline , or  none .       highlight_edit_style   :   underline ,   max_file_size_kb  Sets a limit for how big of a binary file HexViewer will try and convert to a HexView.  Size is in Kilobytes.       // Maximum allowed byte size that HexViewer will parse \n     max_file_size_kb :   50000.0 ,   external_viewer  Sometimes it may be desired to open a hex view in an external editor.  HexViewer, due to the nature of the Sublime Text API is limited in certain ways, so it can be advantageous to open a file in an external hex editor for certain files or certain tasks.   external_viewer  allows the configuring of the external hex editor.   external_viewer  is a dictionary containing to parameters.   viewer , which is an absolute bath the the external hex editor.   args  are the arguments that will be passed to the external editor; it is an array of string arguments.  You can use  ${FILE}  has a place holder for the file path that will be sent to the editor.  HexViewer will insert the actual file path in the place of  ${FILE} .       // External Hex Viewer if max size is exceeded. \n     // Viewer should be the absolute path. \n     // Args is an array of command line arguments. Use ${FILE} for the file path. \n     external_viewer :   { \n         viewer :   , \n         args :   [ ${FILE} ] \n     },   hash_algorithm  The default checksum algorithm to use when creating a hash or checksum (not all values listed below will be found on every platform and system).       // Checksum algorithm default? (the default is what is applied to a file when saving) \n     // (mdc2|md4|md5|sha|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512|ripemd160|crc32|adler32) \n     hash_algorithm   :   md5 ,   checksum_on_save  Controls whether HexViewer will checksum the binary file on save/export.       // Enable checksum on save \n     checksum_on_save   :   true ,   auto_open  Sets whether HexViewer should auto detect binary files and convert them to HexViewer views.  When enabled, HexViewer will detect when a view is set to the  Hexidecimal  syntax, or if the file name matches the  auto_open_patterns  found below.       // Auto open binary files in hex viewer \n     // Detects if view has encoding set to  Hexidecimal . \n     // Additionally it can use  auto_open_patterns  below. \n     auto_open   :   false ,   auto_open_patterns  When  auto_open  is enabled, HexViewer will use the following list of file patterns to detect binary files for auto conversion.       // Auto open patterns to open in hex viewer \n     auto_open_patterns   :   [ *.bin ,   *.pyc ],   disable_auto_open_hex_encoding  Sets whether  auto_open  will convert views with the  Hexidecimal  syntax.       // Disable auto open based on  Hexidecimal  encoding \n     disable_auto_open_hex_encoding :   false ,   use_sub_notify  Enables use of  SubNotify  notifications.       // Use sub notify if available \n     use_sub_notify :   true ,",
