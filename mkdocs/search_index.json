The Hex Inspector is a panel which shows the current selected byte as different unit types: byte (8 bit), short(signed 8 bit), word (16 bit), int (signed 16 bit), dword (double word 32 bit), longint (signed 32 bit), float (32 bit floating point), double (floating point 64 bit), and binary (8 bit binary).\n\n\nHex Viewer: Toggle Endiannes (Big|Little)\n\n\nToggle the parsing of bytes to big or little endian when showing unit types in Hex Inspector\n\n\nHex Viewer: Set Bits Per Group\n\n\nAllows selection from the quick panel the grouping of bytes by 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 bits.  This will reload the file with this formatting.  All edits will be lost, so export your changes before you do this.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Set Bytes Per Line\n\n\nAllows selection form the quick panel the the number of bytes to be shown on a line: 8, 10, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256, 512.  If the selected value is not divisible by the \nbits per group\n, the closet number of bytes per line will be used.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Find By Address\n\n\nFind the byte at the specified address.  Input is received through the input panel.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Show Hex Edit Panel\n\n\nInvoking this command will take the currently selected bytes on a line and display them in an input panel.  They can then be modified and submitted to replace the original bytes.  Strings can also be used by using the \ns:\n prefix followed by the equivalent ASCII characters that are to replace the selected bytes.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Discard All Edits\n\n\nIf at any time you would like to discard all of the changes you have currently made to the hex view, you can invoke this command, and a clean hex view will be reloaded.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Export Bin\n\n\nThis command exports the current hex view to a binary file, and if the option is enabled, it will display the checksum of the newly generated binary file.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Run Checksum\n\n\nBy default, it opens up a quick panel with all available hashes that can be used as a checksum.  When an algorithm is selected, it is used to retrieve the checksum for the current file in hex view mode.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Generate Hash\n\n\nShows a quick panel allowing you to select the desired hash, and then shows an input panel that allows you to specify the string to be hashed. A panel is then displayed with your generated hash according to specifications.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Generate Hash from Selection\n\n\nAllows you to generate hashes from your current selection(s).

If a region contains newlines, they will be hashed as well.\n\n\nHex Viewer: Abort (Hex Conversion|Export|Checksum)\n\n\nAbort the given action.\n\n\nConfigurable settings\n\n\nSettings are configurable in the hex_viewer.sublime-settings file.\n\n\n\n\nconfigure byte highlight color, icon, and style\n\n\nconfigure edit highlight color, icon, and style\n\n\nset default bits per group\n\n\nset default bytes per line\n\n\ncustom font and font size\n\n\nwhether to auto show the Hex Inspector panel on hex view load\n\n\nwhether Hex Inspector is enabled at all\n\n\nhash algorithm to use when checksumming\n\n\nwhether to checksum on file export automatically\n\n\nenable/disable auto open of specified binary files",
